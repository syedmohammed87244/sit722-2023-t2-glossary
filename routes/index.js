  { id: 1, term: 'Keyboard', description: 'A keyboard is a peripheral input device used to input text, commands, and other data into a computer or electronic device. It consists of a set of keys arranged in a specific layout, such as QWERTY, and provides a means of communication between the user and the device.', reference: 'Little, J. (2019). The Complete Keyboard Guide: From Basic Typing to Advanced Shortcuts. New York, NY: ABC Publishers.' },
  { id: 2, term: 'Cloud Storage', description: 'Cloud storage refers to the storage of digital data in remote servers accessible over the internet. It allows users to store, manage, and retrieve their files and data from anywhere and on any device. Cloud storage offers scalability, data redundancy, and convenient data backup and recovery options.', reference: 'Johnson, L. (2020). Cloud Storage: A Comprehensive Guide to Storing and Managing Data in the Cloud. Boston, MA: XYZ Publishing.' },
  { id: 3, term: 'Augmented Reality', description: 'Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information, such as images, videos, or 3D objects, onto the real world in real-time. It enhances the user\'s perception and interaction with the physical environment, providing a blended experience of the real and virtual worlds.', reference: 'Brown, M. (2018). Augmented Reality: Exploring the Intersection of Virtual and Real Worlds. San Francisco, CA: PQR Press.' },
  { id: 4, term: 'Machine Learning', description: 'Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It involves training and optimizing models using large datasets to uncover patterns and insights.', reference: 'Williams, R. (2019). Machine Learning in Practice: Real-world Applications and Use Cases. Seattle, WA: XYZ Publications.' },
  { id: 5, term: 'Internet of Things (IoT)', description: 'The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity capabilities that enable them to collect and exchange data. IoT allows for the integration of the physical and digital worlds, enabling various applications and services.', reference: 'Martin, S. (2020). IoT Essentials: An Introduction to the Internet of Things. Boston, MA: ABC Publishing.' },
  { id: 6, term: 'Virtual Reality', description: 'Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that creates a simulated environment or immersive experience through the use of computer-generated visuals, sounds, and other sensory inputs. It typically involves wearing a VR headset or using specialized equipment to interact with the virtual world.', reference: 'Garcia, L. (2017). Virtual Reality: A Comprehensive Guide to Immersive Experiences. San Francisco, CA: PQR Press.' },
  { id: 7, term: 'Cryptocurrency', description: 'Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. It operates independently of a central bank and is based on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and decentralization.', reference: 'Johnson, M. (2021).
